One such system is last-passage percolation, a model of disordered geometry which depends on a large number of random variables. Our goal is to understand both the asymptotics of this model as the system size tends to infinity, and to what degree these asymptotics depend on the distribution of the random variables. In order to reduce uncertainty, particular attention is paid to computational efficiency and a large number of trials.  On the basis of our simulations, we are led to conjectures for potentially rigorous mathematical theorems. Overall, having insight into this theory facilitates the understanding of many other physical systems.",
